## About me

Iâ€™m currently working on learning Git and preparing my profile to be used as a portfolio. I have about 4 projects written in a .txt file to help get me started and they all cover different types of applications.
Iâ€™m currently learning C (alongside low-level concepts), C#, SQL, Ruby (with RubyOnRails), and Rust.

Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on simple projects that can teach me how to advance my knowledge and develop my collaboration skills with other programmers.
Iâ€™m looking for help with building this portfolio so I may find work in Software development. I'm willing to accept any advice, suggestions and resources to make my coding journey easier.
